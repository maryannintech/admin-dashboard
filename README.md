# Project: Admin-Dashboard

This project is part of The Odin Project intermediate HTML and CSS course, an admin dashboard to apply what I learned in CSS Grid. The layout I copied is [provided](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) by TOP. I only used CSS grid to create the layout and doing this project really help me familiarize with grid. It feels more controlling than Flexbox but I still need more practice mto make it responsive without using media queries. The dummy texts I used is generated by ChatGPT. Overall, I'm really happy with what I made. This concludes the intermediate HTML and CSS course.
